# All Construct

###  Brute force

```python
def all_construct_brute(
    target: str, 
    word_bank: list[str]
) -> list[list[str]]:
    """
    N = length of word_bank
    M = length of target

    Time complexity: O(N^M * M*M)
        Worst case scenario, it will need to check every 
        combination of every value of N while decreasing M 
        (worst scenario will be by 1 character every time).
        As well, in every iteration we copy and remove some 
        characters the target (depending on M).

    Spacial complexity: O(M*M*M)
        It will make up to M recursive calls. And for every call, 
        it will store the suffix of the target.
