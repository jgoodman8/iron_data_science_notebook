# Batch vs Online Learning

### Batch learning

* Training is performed with all the data
* It is performed offline
* It requires more resources and time \(every time the training is performed\)

### Online learning

* Training is performed on mini-batches
* It is offline, as well
* It updates the model \(not overwritten\) - so, it requires less resources.
* It is important to properly set the _regularization parameter_ and check the wellness of all the data fed into the model.
