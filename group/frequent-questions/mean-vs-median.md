## Mean

Found by adding all of the numbers together and dividing by the number of items in the set:

$$
mean(X) = \frac{\sum X_i}{N} , i = 0 ... N
$$

## Median

## Conclusions

* Median is much less sensitive to outliers

difference between standard deviation of a sample and standard error of the population mean
