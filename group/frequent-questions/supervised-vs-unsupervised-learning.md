## Supervised learning

* It requires **labeled data** for training. 
* Tasks are mainly focused on **getting a** _**solution**_ **or** _**prediction**_ expressed as a:
  * Classification
  * Regression

## Unsupervised learning

* It does **not require labeled data** due to it does not perform training.
* Tasks are mainly focused on **getting** _**insights**_ **or** _**guesses**_ through:
  * Clustering
  * Visualization
  * Dimensionality reduction
  * Asociation mining

## An example: KNN vs kMeans

### K-Nearest Neighbors

* Supervised algorithm
* Based in **how similar is an instance from its k neighbors**
* There is no training
* It measures the distance between instances \(Euclidian, Manhattan...\)

### kMeans

* Unsupervised algorithm
* Clustering algorithm
* Iterativelly assigns data to k groups
