Statistical significance is a measure of **whether your research findings are meaningful**. More specifically, itâ€™s whether your stat closely matches what value you would expect to find in an entire population. In order to test for statistical significance, perform these steps:

1. **Decide on an alpha level**. An alpha level is the **error rate you are willing to work with** \(usually 5% or less\).
2. Conduct the research.
3. **Calculate an** [**statistic**](../statistics/statistic-vs-parameter.md) \(from a data sample\).
4. **Compare** the statistic **with one statistic from a** [**statistical table**](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/tables/).
