## Overview

Let's give some clear definitions of outlier:

* **Extreme values** that deviate from other observations on data.
* An observation that **diverges from an overall** pattern on a sample.

## Types

Depending on the number of dimensions that it affects:

* **Univariate outliers**: can be found when looking at a distribution of values in a single feature space.
* **Multivariate outliers**: can be found in a n-dimensional space.

Depending on the environment:

* **Point outliers** are single data points that lay far from the rest of the distribution. 
* **Contextual outliers** can be **noise in data**, such as punctuation symbols when realizing text analysis or background noise signal when doing speech recognition.
* **Collective outliers** can be subsets of novelties in data such as a signal that may indicate the **discovery of new phenomena**.
