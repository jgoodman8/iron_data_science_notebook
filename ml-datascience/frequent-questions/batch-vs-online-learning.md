# Batch vs Online Learning

## Batch learning

* Training is performed with all the data
* It is performed offline
* It requires more resources and time (every time the training is performed)

## Online learning

* Training is performed on mini-batches
* It is offline, as well
* It updates the model (not overwritten) - so, it requires fewer resources.
* It is **important to properly set the **_**regularization parameter**_ and check the wellness of all the data fed into the model.
