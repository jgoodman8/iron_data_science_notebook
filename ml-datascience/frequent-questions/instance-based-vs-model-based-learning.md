# Instance-based vs Model-based Learning

## Instance-based learning

* It makes predictions based on how similar is a new instance to the ones next to it.
* It requires a **measure of similarity**.
* Examples:
  * [k-Nearest Neighbors](https://towardsdatascience.com/knn-k-nearest-neighbors-1-a4707b24bd1d)
  * [Kernel Machines](https://towardsdatascience.com/kernel-function-6f1d2be6091)
  * [Radial Basis Functions Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/radial-basis-functions-neural-networks-all-we-need-to-know-9a88cc053448) \(RBF Networks\)

## Model-based learning

* It "learns" some parameters by a specified **performance measure**, expressed as:
  * a _fitness function:_ how good the model is, or
  * a _cost function:_ how bad the model is.
* Examples:
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision trees
  * ...
