## Supervised learning

* It requires **labeled data** for training.&#x20;
* Tasks are mainly focused on **getting a&#x20;**_**solution**_**&#x20;or&#x20;**_**prediction**_ expressed as a:
  * Classification
  * Regression

## Unsupervised learning

* It does **not require labeled data** due to it does not perform training.
* Tasks are mainly focused on **getting&#x20;**_**insights**_**&#x20;or&#x20;**_**guesses**_ through:
  * Clustering
  * Visualization
  * Dimensionality reduction
  * Asociation mining

## An example: KNN vs kMeans

{% endhint %}

### K-Nearest Neighbors

* Supervised algorithm
* Based on **how similar is an instance from its k neighbors**
* There is no training
* It measures the distance between instances (Euclidian, Manhattan...)

### kMeans

* Unsupervised algorithm
* Clustering algorithm
* Iteratively assigns data to k groups
